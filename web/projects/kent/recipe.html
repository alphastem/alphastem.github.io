        <h2 id="1">Homemade Pepperoni Pizza</h2>
        <h4> Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            
            <li>1/2 (12 ounce) can CONTADINAÂ® Tomato</li> Paste
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper
            
            
            


            
            
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise(R) Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking</li>
        </ol>
