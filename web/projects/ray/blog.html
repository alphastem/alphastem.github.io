        <p>Something exciting happened: I got to watch a video about blogs in my programing class!<br>

        <br> I also had math class today. In math class we learned an easy way to do distributive property mentally.<br>
        
        <br>I also had FLL (First Lego League) at 6:00 today, I created an attachment for the      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUg1SDnjxXI">fountain mission.</a><br>

        <p> Today is Columbus Day! Happy Columbus Day!<br>
        <br>Today I went Ice Skating at Skate Quest with my sister Cindy, she dragged me around the ice trying to get me use to going fast on the ice but everytime she tried to drag me around, I got my hands out of her grip, overall it was fun ice skating!<br>
            
            <br>My sisters friend had a birthday party today, so my sister went. At 6:00 my mom and I went to pick up my sister, when we got there my sister got me some cupcakes! YUMMY!</p>
