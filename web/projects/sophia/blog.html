        <p>Something excited happened.
            I my babysister was born!! That happened when I was at my art class USArts. USArts is two hours but in the middle there is a ten minut break. Mabye 10-20 minutes after break, my dad came unexpectingly and called my name. He told my tacher I had to leave ssoon. Of course that time I knew my mom was in the hostpitle because the baby was causing her a lot of trouble and we were expecting the baby to come out at march. Then  my dad showed me a picture of my baby sister. After that we went to see her. I think it was the most nervouse time of my life!!

         We went with a freind to Main!! We had so much fun. We stayed at a couple of different hotels and we went touring at some mueseums. We went to this Harvard museum and there was a statue of a monk that was very creepy!! My freind and I were thinking that the monks eyes were following us and it's head moved!! We were a bit creeped out after that!

We had two rounds and the blue team won both!!We had a magic trick and I messed up at two times!!It was very fun and I had a amazing time there!! Even after that I had a small playdate with one of my freinds named Christine!!That was amazing time of my life I think!!
