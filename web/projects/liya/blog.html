        <p id="postone" class="paragraph">Trying to figure out how this works, I bet I'll make use of this webpage. </p>
        
        <h3 id="headingtre" class="headingtre">Second Post</h3>
        
        <p id="posttwo" class="paragraph">So, hello there. This is my second post. I'm a coder at <a href="https://khanacademy.org"> khanacademy.org</a>, a website where you can learn many things. <br> <br>
        Right now I'm adding content to my blog, which is a project that the course requires us to do (otherwise I think I'll lose points). I'm working on this in DC, the capital of the USA. I've been here a countless amount of times. </p>
        
        <h3 id="headingtre" class="headingtre"> Third Post</h3>
        
        <p id="posttre" class="paragraph">I just found out that the only way you can get an image from an outside source to show up in your project is to put the link inside and hope the teacher will copy and paste it to an editable html page. It would be quite helpful if it would allow me to actually add pictures and the such. <br> <br>
        For a fun fact, did you know that this took me around 1.5 hours in total? I don't think you knew that. If you did, I'd be surprised.
        </p>
